:: Usage: auto\update.cmd (run from the project root directory)

@echo off
cls

:: setlocal preserves the original environment variables; endlocal restores them before exit
setlocal
set "_EXIT_CODE=0"

:: Require invocation from this repository's root directory
for %%I in ("%~dp0..") do set "PROJECT_ROOT=%%~fI"
for %%I in ("%CD%") do set "CURRENT_DIR=%%~fI"

    set "_EXIT_CODE=1"

:: Self-actualization and stop if it fails
uv self update || goto command_failed

:: Activate the project environment
:: e.g. to separate environment: set VIRTUAL_ENV=C:\Development\VirtualEnvs\radar-3.14.8-uv-env
set "VIRTUAL_ENV=.venv"

:: Replace the installed TA-Lib package after syncing dependencies.
uv pip uninstall talib || goto command_failed

:: Upgrade the project lock file to the latest allowed versions according to the restrictions in pyproject.toml
:: --upgrade  : tries to update all direct and transitive dependencies to the newest compatible version.
uv lock --upgrade || goto command_failed

:: Sync the virtual environment to the project's lock file (uv.lock)
:: --group dev: include the dev dependencies
:: --active   : target the active environment
uv sync --active --group dev || goto command_failed

:: Update TA-lib
uv pip install --no-cache-dir https://github.com/cgohlke/talib-build/releases/download/v0.6.4/ta_lib-0.6.4-cp314-cp314-win_amd64.whl || goto command_failed
