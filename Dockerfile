# Stage 1 Builder: contains build tools to build the radar_core wheel
# The --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM ensures this stage runs on your host's native architecture.

# Install build-time dependencies for TA-Lib, psycopg2, and other tools.
# - apt-get update: Refreshes package index with latest versions
# - apt-get install
#   -y: automatic yes to prompts (non-interactive installation)
#   --no-install-recommends: install only essential dependencies
# - Packages:
#   wget: Utility to download files from the internet (for TA-Lib source).
#   build-essential: Provides compilers and libraries for building Python C extensions (includes 'make' utility)
#   gcc: GNU Compiler Collection (C compiler) needed to compile C code (TA-Lib and Python C-extensions)
#   libpq-dev: Development headers for PostgreSQL, needed to compile psycopg2
# - rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*: removes package lists downloaded with `apt-get update`

# Check for TA-Lib updates: https://github.com/ta-lib/ta-lib/releases
# Download, compile, and install the TA-Lib C library from its source code.
# - wget http://...: Download the TA-Lib source code archive
# - tar -xzf ...: Extract the archive.
# - cd ta-lib/: Change to extracted directory with the source code
# - ./configure --prefix=/usr: Configure the build script for the current system environment
# - make: Compile the source code using the Makefile created by './configure' (creates the shared library 'libta_lib.so.0.0.0')
# - make install: Install the compiled library into the system directories
# - cd ..: Go back to the parent directory, and
# - rm -rf ta-lib*: Clean up downloaded/extracted files
